# Misinformation Project: Analyzing the Role of Influencers in Amplifying Misinformation on Social Media

## **Project Overview**
This project investigates the role of influencers in spreading misinformation on social media, focusing on analyzing patterns in user activity, topics, and keywords associated with rumor tweets. Using the PHEME dataset, we explore how influential users contribute to the amplification of misinformation during critical events.

## **How to Use**

### **Running the Code**
1. Place the dataset file (`dataset.csv`) in the same directory as the script.
2. Modify the file path in the script if required:
   ```python
   filepath = r"C:\Users\YourUser\PathToDataset\dataset.csv"
   ```
3. Execute the script in a Python environment:
   ```bash
   python influencers_misinformation_analysis.py
   ```
4. View the visualizations and results generated by the script.
